Basalt-SublimeTextTheme
=======================

A dark red theme for Sublime Text 2 - its under development but I like it.

Place the Basalt.tmTheme file in packages\Color Scheme - Default

The Preferences.sublime-settings file goes in the User folder

Copy and replace the code in packages\Theme - Default\Default.sublime-theme with this code
